Creating art from noise

## Code

[p5js File](https://editor.p5js.org/)

## Description
In this file, I made dots that leave trails around the screen, generating a random array of colors made from lines.
When hitting the screen, a new black line will cut through the noise, introducing negative space into the canvas.
This allows the drawing to be more interesting and allows you to try and "sketch" something through the randomness.
