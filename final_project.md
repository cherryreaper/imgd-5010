## Code

This program serves as a visual decoder for the COW esolang. It's also got cow print. 

## Other Materials
[Decoder Excel Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11iQ3PvbtJHXpISxHQ8pqUGZqvKxuKY5zbDQ7ts_Vd_Q/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

This sheet was used to decode the language so I could better understand it and check my outputs at different parts of the program.
